    "# Introduction to AI Agents using Open AI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook serves as an introduction to AI Agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK. It provides a basic setup for environment configuration and API key management, establishing the foundation for working with OpenAI's agent framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Structure\n",
    "The notebook contains 3 cells:\n",
    "- **Cell 0**: Title and introduction\n",
    "- **Cell 1**: Environment setup and API key configuration\n",
    "- **Cell 2**: Empty cell (placeholder for future content)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries and Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Library Descriptions\n",
    "- **`os`**: Python's built-in operating system interface module\n",
    "  - Used for accessing environment variables via `os.getenv()`\n",
    "- **`python-dotenv`**: Third-party library for loading environment variables from `.env` files\n",
    "  - Provides the `load_dotenv()` function to automatically load environment variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Key Setup\n",
    "The notebook requires the following environment variable:\n",
    "- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: Your OpenAI API key for accessing OpenAI services\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configuration Process\n",
    "1. **Environment Loading**: Uses `load_dotenv()` to load variables from a `.env` file\n",
    "2. **API Key Retrieval**: Fetches the OpenAI API key using `os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")`\n",
    "3. **Validation**: Checks if the API key is successfully loaded\n",
    "4. **Security**: Provides optional debugging mode to display the key (disabled by default)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Code Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment Setup\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Load environment variables from .env file\n",
    "load_dotenv()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch API keys\n",
    "openai_api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Key Validation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Check if API keys are loaded\n",
    "if openai_api_key:\n",
    "    print(\"‚úÖ API keys are successfully loaded.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: One or more API keys are missing.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security Features\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Optionally, display API keys (for debugging purposes only)\n",
    "display_keys = False  # Change to True if you want to see the keys\n",
    "\n",
    "if display_keys:\n",
    "    print(f\"OpenAI API Key: {openai_api_key}\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"üîí API keys are loaded but hidden for security.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "1. **Python Environment**: Python 3.x with pip package manager\n",
    "2. **Required Packages**: Install using `pip install python-dotenv`\n",
    "3. **OpenAI Account**: Active OpenAI account with API access\n",
    "4. **Environment File**: Create a `.env` file in the project root\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment File (.env)\n",
    "Create a `.env` file with the following content:\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation Commands\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install python-dotenv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure your `.env` file contains the required API key\n",
    "2. **Run the Notebook**: Execute all cells in order\n",
    "3. **Verify Setup**: Check the output messages to confirm API key loading\n",
    "4. **Debug Mode**: Optionally set `display_keys = True` to verify the API key value\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Successful Setup\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚úÖ API keys are successfully loaded.\n",
    "üîí API keys are loaded but hidden for security.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Missing API Key\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: One or more API keys are missing.\n",
    "üîí API keys are loaded but hidden for security.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Security Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **API Key Protection**: Never commit API keys to version control\n",
    "2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for local development\n",
    "3. **Debug Mode**: Only enable `display_keys = True` for troubleshooting\n",
    "4. **File Permissions**: Ensure `.env` file has appropriate read permissions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Issues\n",
    "1. **Missing .env file**: Create the file in the project root directory\n",
    "2. **Invalid API key**: Verify the key format and validity in OpenAI dashboard\n",
    "3. **Import errors**: Ensure `python-dotenv` is installed\n",
    "4. **Permission errors**: Check file permissions for the `.env` file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debug Steps\n",
    "1. Set `display_keys = True` to verify API key loading\n",
    "2. Check the `.env` file format and location\n",
    "3. Verify OpenAI API key is active and has sufficient credits\n",
    "4. Test API key manually using OpenAI's API testing tools\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as a foundation for:\n",
    "- Setting up OpenAI Agents SDK projects\n",
    "- Implementing AI agent workflows\n",
    "- Building more complex agent-based applications\n",
    "- Learning the basics of environment configuration for AI projects\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is designed to be extended with additional agent implementations and more sophisticated AI workflows.\n"
